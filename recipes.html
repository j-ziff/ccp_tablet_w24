            <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) Butter, plus more for baking dish</li>

            <p>Swedish pancakes (Pannkaka [singular] or Pannkakor [plural] in Swedish) are one of the most well-known Scandinavian delicacies, and rightfully so. Tender, buttery and often served with butter and lingonberry jam, there is much to account for their popularity.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter melted and cooled, plus more for the pan</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away. Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter. Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add 1/4 cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan. Continue swirling until the batter is just set. Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed.</li>
                <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter or other desired toppings and/or fillings.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Crispy zucchini fritters are the most delicate, tasty and light dish from this summer vegetable. Fresh greenery and garlic give zucchini pancakes a special taste and aroma. Appetizing soft fritters will taste even those who are indifferent to zucchini. Such a dish is ideal for breakfast or a light snack for half a day. It is desirable to use young zucchini with a thin peel and unripe seeds. If desired, grated hard cheese and finely cut onions can be added to the finished dough. Wheat flour in this recipe can be replaced by rice flour or use semolina in the same proportions.</p>
